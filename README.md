# Vandy-Stock-Analysis
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to learn the basics of VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) and apply it to an investing problem which looked at stock prices for several companies in a two-year span (2017 and 2018).  The data was initially given in daily ticker prices for each company and using VBA we were able to calculate total volume by year, as well as starting and ending prices for each year for each ticker.  This allowed us to see the total yearly volume for each company, as well as the yearly growth for each stock.

## Results
We were tasked to look at the stock "DQ" in particular.  While virtually every stock in the analysis did well in 2017, DQ did exceptionally well, posting a return of 199%, compared with an average return for the stocks of 67%.
